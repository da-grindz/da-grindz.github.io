## Overview

**Da Grindz** is a nutrition-focused web application designed for the students and staff of **UH MƒÅnoa**. It combines local campus dining information with personalized meal planning and nutritional tracking to support healthier eating habits and more mindful food choices.

### Key Features

- Personalized meal recommendations based on allergies, dietary preferences, and nutritional goals.
- Real-time listings and map locations of on-campus food vendors.
- Calendar-based meal planning based on current and future menus.
- Nutritional intake tracking with progress suggestions.
- UH MƒÅnoa-focused experience including local dishes, events, and promotions from vendors.

### Special Sauce: "Mood-Based Meal Matching"

After registration, users set their current **"grindz mood"** (e.g., *ono kine comfort food*, *grindz for gains*, *quick bento run*, *vegetarian vibes*, etc.). This affects:

- Meal suggestions from vendors
- Displayed nutritional goals
- UI themes and motivational quotes tied to that mood

Users can update their mood anytime, and it subtly personalizes how the app talks to them and what it shows.

### Technologies Used

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (Frontend + Backend Routing)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) for persistent data
- Hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- Custom APIs for menu ingestion or scraping (with permission from vendors)

## Development History

The development process for BowFolios conformed to [Issue Driven Project Management](https://courses.ics.hawaii.edu/ics314s25/modules/project-management/) practices. In a nutshell:

* Development consists of a sequence of Milestones.
* Each Milestone is specified as a set of tasks.
* Each task is described using a GitHub Issue, and is assigned to a single developer to complete.
* Tasks should typically consist of work that can be completed in 2-4 days.
* The work for each task is accomplished with a git branch named "issue-XX", where XX is replaced by the issue number.
* When a task is complete, its corresponding issue is closed and its corresponding git branch is merged into master.
* The state (todo, in progress, complete) of each task for a milestone is managed using a GitHub Project Board.

## Continuous Integration

![ci-badge](https://github.com/bowfolios/bowfolios/workflows/ci-bowfolios/badge.svg)

Bowfolios uses [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions) to automatically run ESLint and TestCafe each time a commit is made to the default branch.  You can see the results of all recent "workflows" at [https://github.com/bowfolios/bowfolios/actions](https://github.com/bowfolios/bowfolios/actions).

The workflow definition file is quite simple and is located at
[.github/workflows/ci.yml](https://github.com/bowfolios/bowfolios/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci.yml).
